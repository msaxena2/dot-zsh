# Configuration Related Dotfiles

A collection of various dotfiles, used in conjunction with [dot-home](https://github.com/dot-home/_dot-home).

At the moment, this repository is a submodule in my fork of dot-home. However, for finer grained control, each folder
containing the dotfiles should be in its own repository.
